File permissions in Linux
Project description
Understanding the linux command line helps me automate daily tasks that could take a lot of time to complete. One of the best tools to learn was the command xargs, that helped me change permissions, move, remove, create, and write files with just one command line.
Check file and directory details
Ls -la 
Describe the permissions string
The first letter means if it is a directory or a regular file, the next 9 characters divide in three groups: user, group, others, each group could contain  w=write, r=read, x=execute, or - that means the group does not have any permission.
Change file permissions
Chmod u=+rwx, g=+rwx, o=rwx [file]
Change file permissions on a hidden file
Ls -al
Chmod u=+rwx,g=+rwx, o=+rwx [hidden_file]
Change directory permissions
IWhen you display the files contained in a directory, if the first letter of the string contains a d instead of a - then is a directory, also is highlighted in blue:
Chmod u=+rwx, g=-, o=- [directory]
Summary
Knowing linux commands improves and automate your daily tasks that coil involve a lot of time doing it manually
